We validate our simulations by solving a number of forward problems involving the mechanics of passive filaments and comparing them with known analytical results, and extend them to study instabilities in stretched and twisted filaments that form solenoidal and plectonemic structures. We then study active filaments such as snakes and other slender organisms by solving inverse problems to identify optimal gaits for limbless locomotion on solid surfaces and in bulk liquids.},

Additionally, we describe a manifold projection method for coupling rods to rigid-bodies and simultaneously enforcing rod inextensibility. The use of quasistatics and constraints provides an efficient treatment for stiff twisting and stretching modes; at the same time, we retain the dynamic bending of the centerline and accurately reproduce the coupling between bending and twisting modes. We validate the discrete rod model via quantitative buckling, stability, and coupled-mode experiments, and via qualitative knot-tying comparisons.},

The numerical discretization is based on an isogeometric collocation method, where the geometry and solution fields are represented as {NURBS} curves and the strong forms of the equilibrium equations are collocated at Greville points. In this framework, a frictionless rod-to-rod contact formulation is proposed. Contact points are detected by a coarse-level and a refined search for close centerline points and reaction forces are computed by the actual penetration of rod surface points, so that the enforcement of the contact constraints is performed with the penalty method. An important aspect is the application of contact penalty forces as point loads within the collocation scheme, and methods for this purpose are proposed and evaluated. The overall contact algorithm is validated by and applied to several numerical examples.},

Within the isogeometric framework, the strong forms of the equilibrium equations of forces and moments of the discretized Cosserat model are collocated, leading to an efficient method for higher-order discretizations. For rod structures consisting of multiple, connected rods we introduce a formulation with rigid, quasi-G1-coupling. It is based on the strong enforcement of continuity of displacement and change of cross-section orientation at interfaces. We also develop a mixed isogeometric formulation, which is based on an independent discretization of internal forces and moments and alleviates shear locking for thin rods. The novel rod simulation methods are verified by numerical convergence studies. Further computational examples include realistic applications with large deformations and rotations, as well as a large-scale rod structure with several hundreds of coupled rods and complex buckling behavior.},

Transversally varying material constitutions are represented using non-homogeneous, functionally graded beam cross-section definitions such as laminates and continuously graded cross-sections. Furthermore, to model the axial variation of material and geometry, we introduce the parameterization of cross-section properties as spline curves along the beam centerlines. This fully isogeometric modeling and analysis concept, which is based on spline parameterizations of initial beam centerline curves, kinematic unknowns and axially varying material and geometric parameters, has various practical applications enabled by advances in manufacturing technology, including multi-material 3D printing and advanced manufacturing of composites with automated fiber placement.

The method makes use of higher-order {NURBS} for the contact integral evaluations. The minimum orders of {NURBS} capable of representing the complex geometries exactly are employed for the bulk computations. The proposed methodology provides a possibility to refine the geometry through controllable order elevation for isogeometric analysis. To achieve this, a higher-order {NURBS} layer is used as the contact boundary layer of the bodies. The {NURBS} layer is constructed using different surface refinement strategies such that it is accompanied by a large number of additional degrees of freedom and matches with the bulk parameterization. The capabilities and benefits of the proposed method are demonstrated using the two-dimensional frictionless and frictional contact problems, considering both small and large deformations. The results with the existing fixed-order based {NURBS} discretizations are used for comparisons. Numerical examples show that with the proposed method, a much higher accuracy can be achieved even with a coarse mesh as compared to the existing {NURBS} discretization approach. It exhibits a major gain in the numerical efficiency without the loss of stability, robustness, and the intrinsic features of {NURBS}-based {IGA} technique for a similar accuracy level. The simplicity of the proposed method lends itself to be conveniently embedded in an existing isogeometric contact code after only a few minor modifications.},

We then explore an adaptive isogeometric collocation method that is based on local hierarchical refinement of {NURBS} basis functions and collocation points derived from the corresponding multi-level Greville abscissae. We introduce the concept of weighted collocation that can be consistently developed from the weighted residual form and the two-scale relation of B-splines. Using weighted collocation in the transition regions between hierarchical levels, we are able to reliably handle coincident collocation points that naturally occur for multi-level Greville abscissae. The resulting method combines the favorable properties of isogeometric collocation and hierarchical refinement in terms of computational efficiency, local adaptivity, robustness and straightforward implementation, which we illustrate by numerical examples in one, two and three dimensions.},

We describe the construction of a prototype manipulator structure with six compliant legs connected in a parallel pattern similar to that of a Stewart-Gough platform. We formulate the static forward and inverse kinematics problems for such manipulators as the solution to multiple Cosserat-rod models with coupled boundary conditions, and we test the accuracy of this approach in a set of experiments, including the prediction of leg buckling. An inverse kinematics simulation of slices through the 6 degree-of-freedom ({DOF}) workspace illustrates the kinematic mapping, range of motion, and force required for actuation, which sheds light on the potential advantages and tradeoffs that parallel continuum manipulators may bring.

These characteristics may be useful in micromanipulation, endoscopic robotic-assisted surgery, and human-robot interaction. Our prior work formulated a kinematic model which treats a parallel continuum robot as a set of multiple Cosserat rods with coupled boundary conditions. In this paper, we detail methods for the efficient numerical solution of this model at rates that enable real-time interactive simulation, motion planning, design optimization, and control. Exploitation of the model structure enables a significant reduction in the number of integrations required to evaluate the boundary value Jacobian matrix used in a shooting method. Our approach is used to teleoperate a prototype robot using real-time inverse kinematics solutions, and simulation tests show that inverse kinematics solutions are consistently computed at rates of several kilohertz using standard desktop computing hardware.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to solve the equations of geometrically exact 3D nonlinear Cosserat static rods under large displacements with a mesh free alternative method to finite elements: the shooting method. One of the main goal of the work presented is to introduce a new multiple shooting method to handle geometrical discontinuities as well as beams assembled through mechanical linkages in a multi-body framework. An additional purpose is to propose a new shooting method algorithm in which the dual set of Modified Rodrigues Parameters ({MRP}) and Shadow Modified Rodrigues Parameters ({SMRP}) are used for rotations parameterization along the length of the beam in order to model extremely large rotations. Several numerical examples demonstrate the validity, the performance and accuracy of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Parallel continuum robots ({PCRs}) combine the compactness, simplicity, and compliance of continuum robots with the precision and strength of rigid-link parallel robots. In this paper, we provide a generalized Cosserat-rod-based kinetostatic model framework that accommodates various joint types and problem formulations (e.g., forward and inverse kinematics under loads, and deflection-based and actuation-based force sensing) useful for simulation and control. Linearization of this general model provides the manipulator Jacobian, end-effector compliance, input stiffness, and wrench reflectivity matrices, which allow us to examine the effect of design parameters on dexterity, force application, and force-sensing ability. Using ellipsoids based on the matrices, we provide a set of design simulations and graphically depict the relationships between pose, actuation, and forces. We further provide a nondimensional analysis of the compliance of {PCRs}. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate and validate actuation-based force sensing on a prototype six-degree-of-freedom {PCR}, demonstrating 3-D force sensing with a median magnitude and a directional error of 0.23 N (8\% of actual load) and 12°, respectively.},

	abstract = {Geometric Fundamentals of Robotics provides an elegant introduction to the geometric concepts that are important to applications in robotics. This second edition is still unique in providing a deep understanding of the subject: rather than focusing on computational results in kinematics and robotics, it includes significant state-of-the art material that reflects important advances in the field, connecting robotics back to mathematical fundamentals in group theory and geometry. Key features: * Begins with a brief survey of basic notions in algebraic and differential geometry, Lie groups and Lie algebras * Examines how, in a new chapter, Clifford algebra is relevant to robot kinematics and Euclidean geometry in 3D * Introduces mathematical concepts and methods using examples from robotics * Solves substantial problems in the design and control of robots via new methods * Provides solutions to well-known enumerative problems in robot kinematics using intersection theory on the group of rigid body motions * Extends dynamics, in another new chapter, to robots with end-effector constraints, which lead to equations of motion for parallel manipulators Geometric Fundamentals of Robotics serves a wide audience of graduate students as well as researchers in a variety of areas, notably mechanical engineering, computer science, and applied mathematics. It is also an invaluable reference text. ----- From a Review of the First Edition: "The majority of textbooks dealing with this subject cover various topics in kinematics, dynamics, control, sensing, and planning for robot manipulators. The distinguishing feature of this book is that it introduces mathematical tools, especially geometric ones, for solving problems in robotics. In particular, Lie groups and allied algebraic and geometric concepts are presented in a comprehensive manner to an audience interested in robotics. The aim of the author is to show the power and elegance of these methods as they apply to problems in robotics." --{MathSciNet}},

	abstract = {Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms presents the subject of computational rigid-body dynamics through the medium of spatial 6D vector notation. It explains how to model a rigid-body system and how to analyze it, and it presents the most comprehensive collection of the best rigid-body dynamics algorithms to be found in a single source. The use of spatial vector notation greatly reduces the volume of algebra which allows systems to be described using fewer equations and fewer quantities. It also allows problems to be solved in fewer steps, and solutions to be expressed more succinctly. In addition algorithms are explained simply and clearly, and are expressed in a compact form. The use of spatial vector notation facilitates the implementation of dynamics algorithms on a computer: shorter, simpler code that is easier to write, understand and debug, with no loss of efficiency. Unique features include: • A comprehensive collection of the best rigid-body dynamics algorithms • Use of spatial (6D) vectors to greatly reduce the volume of algebra, to simplify the treatment of the subject, and to simplify the computer code that implements the algorithms • Algorithms expressed both mathematically and in pseudocode for easy translation into computer programs • Source code for many algorithms available on the internet Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms is aimed at readers who already have some elementary knowledge of rigid-body dynamics, and are interested in calculating the dynamics of a rigid-body system. This book serves as an algorithms recipe book as well as a guide to the analysis and deeper understanding of rigid-body systems.},

	abstract = {Simulators have played a critical role in robotics research as tools for quick and efficient testing of new concepts, strategies, and algorithms. To date, most simulators have been restricted to 2D worlds, and few have matured to the point where they are both highly capable and easily adaptable. Gazebo is designed to fill this niche by creating a 3D dynamic multi-robot environment capable of recreating the complex worlds that would be encountered by the next generation of mobile robots. Its open source status, fine grained control, and high fidelity place Gazebo in a unique position to become more than just a stepping stone between the drawing board and real hardware: data visualization, simulation of remote environments, and even reverse engineering of blackbox systems are all possible applications. Gazebo is developed in cooperation with the Player and Stage projects (Gerkey, B. P., et al., July 2003), (Gerkey, B. P., et al., May 2001), (Vaughan, R. T., et al., Oct. 2003), and is available from http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/gazebo/ gazebo.html.},
